# NY-Yellow-Taxi-Trips-Analysis
In this analysis we challenged ourselves to work with bigger data on our local hosts using parallel processing with Dask. We analysed data of New York yellow taxi trips during January 2016.

We checked for average price, distance and time travelled, the busiest time of the day, the distance, average speed or time travelled by time of the day. We also plotted selected pickup locations. We used interactive plotting libraries Bookeh, Folium and Plotly.

Note: Unfortunately the interactive graphs from Plotly, Folium or Bookeh are not visible on GitHub, but you can go over the code regardless.
